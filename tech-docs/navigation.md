## **Overview**

SRE.ai is designed to streamline the full DevOps lifecycle across three pillars: **Development**, **Deployment**, and **Maintenance**.&#x20;

The sidebar organizes core tools and workflows that map directly to this lifecycle.

## **Home**

The dashboard landing page. Quickly view recent activity, environment health, and relevant updates across your connected systems.

## **Changes**

Track and manage metadata and code changes in real time.

This is where developers can select metadata types, view diffs, and initiate change tracking across connected Salesforce environments.

## **Collections**

Group multiple changes into a single unit of work.

Collections are ideal for managing sprint-based development, releases, or bundles of changes that need to be tested or promoted together.

## **Instances**

Manage the orgs or environments connected to your repository.

Each instance corresponds to a Salesforce environment (e.g., Dev, QA, Staging) and can be assigned to a branch. Use this section to spin up environments, track status, or reset configurations.

## Repositories

Configure and connect Git repositories used for version control.

This section enables repo management, Git strategy configuration, and source format settings (e.g., Metadata Source vs. Extended Source).

## **Flows**

Create declarative workflows using triggers and steps.

Flows automate multi-step processes, like deployments, Jira updates, or environment resets, without requiring custom scripting. Built for reusability and flexibility across teams.

## **Activities**

View a detailed log of actions taken across the platform.

Activities show who did what, when, including:&#x20;

* Promotions
* Commits
* Deployments
* Flow executions

## **Pipeline**

Monitor end-to-end CI/CD pipelines.

The pipeline view connects repositories, environments, and automation flows to give you a birdâ€™s-eye view of your release process.

## **Jobs**

Track automated or manually triggered executions.

Jobs represent deployments, flow runs, environment resets, or metadata syncs. This view provides visibility into job status, logs, and results.
