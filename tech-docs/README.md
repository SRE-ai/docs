# Welcome

SRE.ai redefines DevOps with **AI-driven automation**. \
\
Instead of relying on pre-configured scripts and manual configurations, SRE.ai integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to interpret user intent and map it to backend operations dynamically. This approach, called **Cognitive DevOps**, positions AI as an **adaptive teammate** rather than a passive automation tool.

### **What is SRE.ai?**

SRE.ai is a cross-platform application for Salesforce developers, analysts, and release managers to work on and collaborate on their next feature, project, or release within a single platform.

SRE.ai enables you to package metadata, permissions, and data changes in simple constructs and commit, merge, build, and release those changes in a controlled manner. The data generated is saved locally and natively in Salesforce.

We built SRE.ai using Electron, which powers popular applications such as Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Postman.

### **Why SRE.ai?**

Salesforce is a robust platform that allows for customization through configuration and code. However, moving a new feature from development to production can be challenging, especially when multiple teams work on different features and projects concurrently.

SRE.ai simplifies this process by streamlining the management of multiple features, projects, and environments and helping users focus on the most critical tasks.

### **How does** SRE.ai **work?**

SRE.ai aims to simplify change and release management in Salesforce by addressing common pain points such as tracking changes, committing code, merging changes, and building applications.

SRE.ai offers flexibility by allowing teams to choose the tools, processes, and strategies that work best for them.
