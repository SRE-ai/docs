# Deploy

In addition to Promote, SRE.ai offers Deploy as a standalone feature for packages and tags. Deploy allows users to push changes between environments while skipping git in the process, should the need arise.

The deployment artifacts can be retrieved from any environment or pulled from the repository and then deployed to any desired target environment. This feature gives users more control over the deployment process.

{% hint style="info" %}
Deploy has its own permissions that can be customized for each instance.

SRE.ai maintains a record of the deployment log and build artifacts for every deployment or validation carried out.
