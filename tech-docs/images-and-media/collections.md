# Collections

Using Collections to group Changes lets you track and manage multiple features simultaneously. For example, if you are working on a sprint or release, you can use Collections to group the Changes that are related to this work. Collections makes it easier to promote or deploy all of the associated Changes together.

You can also use Collections to cherry-pick specific changes or features to include or exclude from a deployment or release by adding or removing the corresponding Changes from a Collection.

Collections combines the following elements that are associated with the underlying Changes:

* Metadata types
* Data
* Tasks
* Scripts

Information can be retrieved from environments or pulled from a repository.
