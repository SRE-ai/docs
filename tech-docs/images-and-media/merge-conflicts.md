# Merge conflicts

Even though SRE.ai significantly reduces the likelihood of merge conflicts, conflicts can still occur when multiple users are working on the same component simultaneously. Merge conflicts are a natural part of the development process, and SRE.ai has robust support for resolving them.

You can use any tool to resolve merge conflicts, and SRE.ai will capture and save the resolution for each hunk of code. SRE.ai automatically reapplies the solution when it reencounters the same conflict in the release chain. SRE.ai streamlines resolving conflicts and ensures changes are correctly applied and consistently throughout the environment chain.
