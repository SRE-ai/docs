## Overview

Flows empower you to orchestrate complex, multi-step processes seamlessly.&#x20;

Flows integrate various applications and trigger criteria to streamline operations.

## **Features**

### **Triggers for automation**

Flows features Triggers to automate DevOps workflows based on specific criteria.&#x20;

Triggers allow you to initiate processes exactly when needed, whether it's:

* After a commit,&#x20;
* After a change in a Jira issue
* During a scheduled time.

Learn more about Triggers in[ SRE.ai's Triggers documentation](triggers/).

### **Declarative approach**

Flows take a declarative approach.&#x20;

With Flows, you define what you want to achieve without worrying about the technical details of how it gets done.

Flows make it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds and reduce the learning curve significantly.

### **Step orchestration**

Flows lets you orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple steps and dependencies.

Flows ensure Steps execute in the correct order.&#x20;

You define the right conditions and criteria to keep the process smooth and error-free.

Learn more about Steps in [SRE.ai's Steps documentation](steps/).

### Comprehensive workflow support

Combining Triggers and Steps allows you to customize your workflows to meet your specific needs.

Here are some functions you can execute with combinations of Triggers and Steps:

* Promote changes when a pull request is approved
* Automatically update a Jira issue when you promote a change to an environment.
* Enable continuous integration and continuous deployment
* Create and install package versions based on git operations
* Maintain a pool of scratch-orgs with up-to-date packages, data, and configurations
* Enhance team communication by posting messages to Slack channels directly from your workflows
