# Triggers

What are Triggers?

Triggers are the entry points to a Flow in SRE.ai.&#x20;

Each Trigger listens for a specific event, such as:

* A pull request opening
* A commit being merged
* A manual user action&#x20;

Triggers initiate Flows once their specific event occurs.

Triggers help you respond automatically to DevOps activity without polling, scripts, or brittle automations.

## Available Triggers

Click any Trigger in a Flow to customize the Trigger.
