# Triggers

## What are Triggers?

Triggers are the entry points to a Flow in SRE.ai.&#x20;

Each Trigger listens for a specific event, such as:

* A pull request opening
* A commit being merged
* A manual user action&#x20;

Triggers initiate Flows once their specific event occurs.

Triggers help you respond automatically to DevOps activity without polling, scripts, or brittle automations.

## Available Triggers

SRE.ai offers six different Triggers:

* Manual&#x20;
* Schedule
* Webhook
* Commit
* Promote
* Deployment
