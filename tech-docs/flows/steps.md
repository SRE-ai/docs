# Steps

## What are Steps?

Steps are the actions that your Flow performs after being triggered.&#x20;

You can string multiple Steps together to create powerful, rule-based automations across your DevOps pipeline.

## How Steps work in SRE.ai:

* Drag and drop Steps in the Flow builder
* Configure each Step with field-level detail&#x20;
  * For example:
    * Which environment to promote to&#x20;
    * What text to send to Slack
* Use built-in templates for fast setup

## Example Steps:

* Promote Collection to an Environment
* Update a Jira Issue
* Post a message to Slack
* Assign uncommitted metadata to a PR
* Reset a Salesforce Sandbox
