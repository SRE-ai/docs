# Triggers

## What are Triggers?

Triggers are the entry points to a Flow in SRE.ai.&#x20;

Each Trigger listens for a specific event, such as a pull request opening, a commit being merged, or a manual user action, and initiates the Flow once its conditions are met.

## How Triggers work in SRE.ai:

* Add Triggers from the Flow Builder panel
* Choose from available trigger types (e.g., "When a PR is opened")
* Customize conditions using the declarative UI (e.g., branch name = main)
* Combine multiple Triggers for broader automation control\


## Available Trigger types include:

* PR opened
* Collection promoted
* Branch created
* Environment reset
* Manual trigger

Triggers help you respond automatically to real DevOps activity without polling, scripts, or brittle automations.
