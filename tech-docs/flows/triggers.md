# Triggers

## What are Triggers?

Triggers are the entry points to a Flow in SRE.ai.&#x20;

Each Trigger listens for a specific event, such as:

* A pull request opening
* A commit being merged
* A manual user action&#x20;

Triggers initiate Flows once their specific event occurs.

Triggers help you respond automatically to DevOps activity without polling, scripts, or brittle automations.

## How Triggers work in SRE.ai:

* Add Triggers from the Flow Builder panel
* Choose from available trigger types&#x20;
  * &#x20;For example, "When a PR is opened"
* Customize conditions using the declarative UI
  * For example, branch name = main
* Combine multiple Triggers for broader automation control\


## Available Trigger types include:

* PR opened
* Collection promoted
* Branch created
* Environment reset
* Manual trigger
