# Integrations

## Overview

SRE.ai’s platform begins with integrations.

Our core value lies in bridging DevOps complexity across systems, starting with Salesforce and expanding soon to other enterprise platforms like SAP.&#x20;

Integrations enable SRE.ai to serve as your intelligent DevOps assistant, monitoring, interpreting, and acting across your stack.

## Why Integrations matter

Modern DevOps processes live across dozens of systems.&#x20;

Without a central source of truth, teams struggle with fragmented workflows, brittle automations, and delays that compound over time.&#x20;

SRE.ai solves this by integrating directly into your systems of record, bringing all your workflows under one roof.
