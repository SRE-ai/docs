# Integrations

## Overview

SRE.ai’s platform begins with integrations.

Our core value lies in bridging DevOps complexity across systems, starting with Salesforce and expanding soon to other enterprise platforms like SAP.&#x20;

Integrations enable SRE.ai to serve as your intelligent DevOps assistant: listening, interpreting, and acting across your stack.

## Why Integrations matter

Modern DevOps processes live across dozens of systems.&#x20;

Without a central source of truth, teams struggle with fragmented workflows, brittle automations, and delays that compound over time.&#x20;

SRE.ai solves this by integrating directly into your systems of record, bringing all your workflows under one roof.

## What you’ll find here

This section includes step-by-step guides for setting up and managing integrations with tools like:

* **Salesforce** – Set up managed packages, connect GitHub actions, and configure authentication via SSO.
* **GitHub** – Authorize and sync secrets, variables, and workflows for continuous deployment.
* **Slack (via Flows)** – Automate communication touchpoints from inside your DevOps pipeline.

Each integration guide is written to be scannable, repeatable, and reliable, ensuring setup can be completed confidently by any team member, technical or not.

## Coming soon

We're actively working to support more integrations across the enterprise ecosystem, including:

* SAP
* etc.
