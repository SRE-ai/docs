# Infinit

### **What is infinit?**

Infinit is a cross-platform application for Salesforce developers, analysts, and release managers to work on and collaborate on their next feature, project, or release within a single platform.

Infinit enables you to package metadata, permissions, and data changes in simple constructs and commit, merge, build, and release those changes in a controlled manner. The data generated is saved locally and natively in Salesforce.

We built Infinit using Electron, which powers popular applications such as Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Postman.

### **Why infinit?**

Salesforce is a robust platform that allows for customization through configuration and code. However, moving a new feature from development to production can be challenging, especially when multiple teams work on different features and projects concurrently.

infinit simplifies this process by streamlining the management of multiple features, projects, and environments and helping users focus on the most critical tasks.

### **How does infinit work?**

infinit aims to simplify change and release management in Salesforce by addressing common pain points such as tracking changes, committing code, merging changes, and building applications.

infinit offers flexibility by allowing teams to choose the tools, processes, and strategies that work best for them. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into how infinit accomplishes this.
